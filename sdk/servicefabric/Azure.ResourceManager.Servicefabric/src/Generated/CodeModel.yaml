            If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node, the health is evaluated as Warning.

                            The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
                            If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node, the health is evaluated as Warning.

                            The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes. Default percentage is zero.

                            In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.

                                        The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of deployed applications that can be unhealthy before the application is considered in error.
                                        This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy deployed applications over the number of nodes where the application is currently deployed on in the cluster.
                                        The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes. Default percentage is zero.
